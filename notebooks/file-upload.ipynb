    "An API key should be kept secret.\n",
    "Treat it like you would a password to access data at your center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that a common way for secrets to be exposed is by hardcoding them into software or configuration files. \n",
    "Once the code is checked into a version control repository, the secrets remain in the history even after they are removed from the current version of the code.\n",
    "So, before you start using your key in your scripts, please be sure you have a good secret management strategy in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we just prompt the user for the key.\n",
    "And, while this avoids storing the key, it is not practical for automated transfers and you will need a different strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding your API key\n",
    "\n",
    "Each API key is associated with a particular user. \n",
    "To get the API key, login as the user to the NACC Flywheel instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the \"avatar\" in the upper right corner (generally a circle with your initials).\n",
    "2. Click the avatar dropdown, and select \"Profile\".\n",
    "3. Under \"Flywheel Access\" at the bottom of the resulting page, click \"Generate API Key\".\n",
    "4. Choose a key name relevant to upload, set the expiration date, and create the API Key.\n",
    "5. Copy the API Key since you wont be able to access the value later.\n",
