# Scripted Flywheel Access

## Preliminaries

### Login

1. In Google Chrome, go to [flywheel.naccdata.org](https://flywheel.naccdata.org).
2. Click the button "University Credentials via CILogon"
3. Under "Select an Identity Provider" choose "University of Washington" and click the "Log On" button.
4. You should be taken to the UW login page and be asked to login using 2FA.

### Creating your API Key

An API key allows you to access Flywheel programmatically.
It should be treated like a password, though you'll need to have a copy on your computer.

1. Find the "avatar" in the upper right corner. 
   This is a circle with your initials.
2. Click the avatar dropdown, and select "Profile"
3. Under "Flywheel Access" at the bottom of the page, click "Generate API Key".
4. Set key name to "tutorial-access" and leave the expiration date set to a month away.
5. Make a copy of your API key and save it on your machine.

### Install a Python Environment

As a first step for using Jupyter notebooks, you'll need a Python environment installed on your computer.

We suggest these steps to
[Install Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#install-python)
