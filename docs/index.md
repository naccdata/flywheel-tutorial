# NACC Flywheel Tutorial

The goal of this this breakout to help members of NACC become familiar with how ADRC data is stored in Flywheel, how to use the Flywheel User Interface to access the data, and how to use Python Jupyter notebooks to work with Flywheel. The breakout will be split between using the Flywheel interface and using Jupyter notebooks.

For the first session, participants should bring their laptop with the Google Chrome browser installed, and having checked that they can login to flywheel.naccdata.org.

For the second session, participants will need a Python environment installed that supports Jupyter notebooks.
We suggest following these [instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/#install-python).

We will set aside a few minutes to do any troubleshooting that might be needed.
